# DR3 - Mood-based Recommendation System 🤖✨

This is a prototype application that uses BERT for mood detection and OpenAI GPT for generating responses, all wrapped in a user-friendly Streamlit app.

### 🔧 Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run setup once:
```bash
python setup_env.py
```
4. Launch the app:
```bash
streamlit run dr3_app.py

### 🔐 Keep your API key safe!
Your `.env` file will store your OpenAI API key and is already ignored from GitHub via `.gitignore`.
